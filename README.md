# Description
This is a game where rooms are loaded into path, quest and item files. Using specific formatting for these files, rooms will be generated in the command prompt window. Using the arrow keys and quest commands, the user will attempt to complete all the quests in a sequential order to finish the game. The game can be ended by typing "quests" when all quests are completed.
Note: all commands in this game are case insensitive.
# Things That I Have Learned
This is the first program that I have created at the University of Sydney and was completed as an assignment. This assignment also allowed me to learn git version control, git commands and the benefits of Git.
